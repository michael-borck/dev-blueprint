## üìù Example 1: Blog Search Feature

**Context:** Adding search functionality to an existing blog platform

### Phase 1: PRD Creation

**Initial Request:**
```
"I want to add search to my blog so users can find articles easily"
```

**AI Clarifying Questions & Responses:**
```
Q: What should users be able to search? (titles, content, tags, authors?)
A: Titles, content, and tags primarily

Q: Should search include filters? (date range, categories, etc.)
A: Yes - by category, date range, and author

Q: What's the expected search performance? (how many articles, response time?)
A: ~500 articles currently, expecting <1 second response time

Q: Should search work offline or require internet?
A: Internet required, it's a web platform

Q: Any specific search algorithms or should it be basic text matching?
A: Smart matching with typo tolerance would be nice
```
