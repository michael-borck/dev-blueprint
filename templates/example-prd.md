# PRD: User Profile Editing Feature

## Introduction/Overview

Users currently cannot edit their profile information after initial account creation, leading to support tickets and user frustration. This feature will allow users to update their personal information, profile picture, and preferences through a dedicated settings page.

**Goal:** Enable users to easily update and maintain their profile information without requiring support intervention.

## Goals

1. Reduce profile-related support tickets by 80%
2. Increase user profile completion rate from 60% to 85%
3. Improve user satisfaction scores related to account management
4. Enable users to keep their information current and accurate

## User Stories

1. **As a new user**, I want to complete my profile after initial signup so that my account reflects my current information.

2. **As an existing user**, I want to update my profile picture so that my account shows a current photo.

3. **As a user with changed personal details**, I want to update my contact information so that I receive notifications and communications at the correct addresses.

4. **As a privacy-conscious user**, I want to control what information is visible to other users so that I can maintain my desired level of privacy.

## Functional Requirements

1. The system must allow users to edit their display name, email, and bio text.
2. The system must support profile picture upload with automatic resizing to 200x200px.
3. The system must validate email addresses and prevent duplicate emails across accounts.
4. The system must provide real-time field validation with clear error messages.
5. The system must save changes immediately upon clicking "Save" button.
6. The system must send email confirmation when email address is changed.
7. The system must maintain audit trail of profile changes for security purposes.
8. The system must allow users to set privacy preferences for profile visibility.

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- Changing username (requires separate security workflow)
- Password changes (handled by existing security module)
- Account deletion (requires legal compliance workflow)
- Social media integration
- Bulk profile imports/exports

## Dependencies

- **Authentication Service:** Must integrate with existing auth module for user verification
- **File Storage Service:** AWS S3 bucket for profile picture storage
- **Email Service:** SendGrid integration for email confirmations
- **Image Processing Library:** Sharp.js for image resizing and optimization
- **Database:** User table modifications required

## Timeline & Priority

- **Priority:** High (blocking user satisfaction improvements)
- **Timeline:** 3 weeks total
- **Phase 1 (Week 1):** Basic text field editing
- **Phase 2 (Week 2):** Profile picture upload
- **Phase 3 (Week 3):** Privacy settings and email confirmation

## Risk Assessment

**Technical Risks:**
- Image upload/processing performance impact - *Mitigation: Implement async processing*
- Email validation conflicts with existing accounts - *Mitigation: Comprehensive duplicate checking*

**Business Risks:**  
- Users accidentally changing critical information - *Mitigation: Email confirmations for sensitive changes*
- Privacy settings confusion - *Mitigation: Clear UI labeling and help text*

**User Experience Risks:**
- Form complexity overwhelming new users - *Mitigation: Progressive disclosure and optional fields*

## Accessibility Requirements

- Form fields must have proper ARIA labels and descriptions
- Profile picture upload must work with screen readers
- All interactive elements must be keyboard navigable
- Color contrast must meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- Error messages must be announced to assistive technologies

## Design Considerations

- Follow existing design system components and patterns
- Profile picture should display placeholder avatar when no image uploaded
- Form should use progressive enhancement (work without JavaScript)
- Mobile-responsive design required for all screen sizes
- Consistent with existing settings page layout

## Technical Considerations

- Use existing form validation library for consistency
- Implement optimistic UI updates with rollback capability
- Profile pictures should be served from CDN for performance
- Consider rate limiting for profile updates to prevent abuse
- Ensure proper CSRF protection on all form submissions

## Success Metrics

1. **Support Ticket Reduction:** 80% decrease in profile-related tickets within 30 days
2. **User Engagement:** 70% of users update their profile within first week of feature launch  
3. **Profile Completion:** Increase from 60% to 85% complete profiles
4. **User Satisfaction:** Profile management satisfaction score >4.5/5
5. **Technical Performance:** Profile save operations complete in <2 seconds

## Open Questions

1. Should profile changes require immediate email notification to the user?
2. What file size limits should be enforced for profile pictures?
3. Should we allow animated GIFs as profile pictures?
4. How long should the email confirmation link remain valid?
5. Should profile visibility settings be per-field or global?
