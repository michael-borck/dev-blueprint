## üìù Example Contribution

### Improving PRD Creation Prompts

**Problem:** Current prompts don't adequately address API design requirements.

**Solution:**
```markdown
Add to clarifying questions section:

*   **API Design:** "What are the expected API endpoints and data formats?"
*   **Rate Limiting:** "Are there performance or rate limiting requirements?"
*   **Versioning:** "How should API versioning be handled?"
*   **Documentation:** "What API documentation standards should be followed?"

Add to PRD Structure:

14. **API Specification:** Document endpoint design, request/response formats, and authentication requirements.
```

**Testing:**
- Tested with ChatGPT, Claude, and Cursor
- Generated more comprehensive PRDs for API features
- Improved task breakdown accuracy
