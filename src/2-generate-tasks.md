# Dev Blueprint: Generating a Task List from a PRD

## Goal

To guide an AI assistant in creating a detailed, step-by-step task list in Markdown format based on an existing Product Requirements Document (PRD). The task list should guide a developer through implementation.

## Output

- **Format:** Markdown (`.md`)
- **Location:** `/tasks/`
- **Filename:** `tasks-[prd-file-name].md` (e.g., `tasks-prd-user-profile-editing.md`)

## Process

1.  **Receive PRD Reference:** The user points the AI to a specific PRD file
2.  **Analyze PRD:** The AI reads and analyzes the functional requirements, user stories, and other sections of the specified PRD.
3.  **Phase 1: Generate Parent Tasks:** Based on the PRD analysis, create the file and generate the main, high-level tasks required to implement the feature. Use your judgement on how many high-level tasks to use. It's likely to be about 5. Present these tasks to the user in the specified format (without sub-tasks yet). Inform the user: "I have generated the high-level tasks based on the PRD. Ready to generate the sub-tasks? Respond with 'Go' to proceed."
4.  **Wait for Confirmation:** Pause and wait for the user to respond with "Go".
5.  **Phase 2: Generate Sub-Tasks:** Once the user confirms, break down each parent task into smaller, actionable sub-tasks necessary to complete the parent task. Ensure sub-tasks logically follow from the parent task and cover the implementation details implied by the PRD.
6.  **Identify Relevant Files:** Based on the tasks and PRD, identify potential files that will need to be created or modified. List these under the `Relevant Files` section, including corresponding test files if applicable.
7.  **Generate Final Output:** Combine the parent tasks, sub-tasks, relevant files, and notes into the final Markdown structure.
8.  **Save Task List:** Save the generated document in the `/tasks/` directory with the filename `tasks-[prd-file-name].md`, where `[prd-file-name]` matches the base name of the input PRD file (e.g., if the input was `prd-user-profile-editing.md`, the output is `tasks-prd-user-profile-editing.md`).

## Output Format

The generated task list _must_ follow this structure:

```markdown
## Relevant Files

- `path/to/potential/file1.ts` - Brief description of why this file is relevant (e.g., Contains the main component for this feature).
- `path/to/file1.test.ts` - Unit tests for `file1.ts`.
- `path/to/another/file.tsx` - Brief description (e.g., API route handler for data submission).
- `path/to/another/file.test.tsx` - Unit tests for `another/file.tsx`.
- `lib/utils/helpers.ts` - Brief description (e.g., Utility functions needed for calculations).
- `lib/utils/helpers.test.ts` - Unit tests for `helpers.ts`.

### Notes

- Unit tests should typically be placed alongside the code files they are testing (e.g., `MyComponent.tsx` and `MyComponent.test.tsx` in the same directory).
- Use `npx jest [optional/path/to/test/file]` to run tests. Running without a path executes all tests found by the Jest configuration.

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests:** Test individual components and functions in isolation
- **Integration Tests:** Test component interactions and data flow
- **End-to-End Tests:** Test complete user workflows
- **Accessibility Tests:** Verify WCAG compliance and screen reader compatibility

## Tasks

- [ ] 1.0 Parent Task Title [Effort: S/M/L] [Priority: High/Medium/Low]
  - [ ] 1.1 [Sub-task description 1.1] [Definition of Done: specific completion criteria]
  - [ ] 1.2 [Sub-task description 1.2] [Prerequisites: Task dependencies]
- [ ] 2.0 Parent Task Title [Effort: S/M/L] [Priority: High/Medium/Low]
  - [ ] 2.1 [Sub-task description 2.1] [Definition of Done: specific completion criteria]
- [ ] 3.0 Parent Task Title [Effort: S/M/L] [Priority: High/Medium/Low]
  - (may not require sub-tasks if purely structural or configuration)

### Task Legend
- **Effort:** S (Small: <4 hours), M (Medium: 4-8 hours), L (Large: >8 hours)
- **Priority:** High (blocking), Medium (important), Low (nice-to-have)
- **Definition of Done:** Specific criteria that must be met to consider the task complete
- **Prerequisites:** Other tasks that must be completed first
```

## Interaction Model

The process explicitly requires a pause after generating parent tasks to get user confirmation ("Go") before proceeding to generate the detailed sub-tasks. This ensures the high-level plan aligns with user expectations before diving into details.

## Target Audience

Assume the primary reader of the task list is a **junior developer** who will implement the feature.
