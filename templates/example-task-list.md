# Task List: User Profile Editing Feature

## Relevant Files

- `src/components/ProfileEditForm.tsx` - Main profile editing form component
- `src/components/ProfileEditForm.test.tsx` - Unit tests for profile form
- `src/components/ProfilePictureUpload.tsx` - Profile picture upload component  
- `src/components/ProfilePictureUpload.test.tsx` - Unit tests for picture upload
- `src/pages/settings/profile.tsx` - Profile settings page container
- `src/pages/settings/profile.test.tsx` - Integration tests for profile page
- `src/api/routes/profile.ts` - API endpoints for profile operations
- `src/api/routes/profile.test.ts` - API endpoint tests
- `src/lib/validation/profileSchema.ts` - Profile data validation schemas
- `src/lib/validation/profileSchema.test.ts` - Validation schema tests
- `src/lib/utils/imageProcessor.ts` - Image processing utilities
- `src/lib/utils/imageProcessor.test.ts` - Image processing tests
- `database/migrations/002_add_profile_audit_trail.sql` - Database schema changes

### Notes

- Unit tests should typically be placed alongside the code files they are testing (e.g., `ProfileEditForm.tsx` and `ProfileEditForm.test.tsx` in the same directory).
- Use `npx jest [optional/path/to/test/file]` to run tests. Running without a path executes all tests found by the Jest configuration.

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests:** Test individual components and functions in isolation
- **Integration Tests:** Test component interactions and data flow
- **End-to-End Tests:** Test complete user workflows
- **Accessibility Tests:** Verify WCAG compliance and screen reader compatibility
